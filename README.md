# Comparing-Multiple-Pre-trained-Neural-network-models-on-IMDB-dataset
 First five neural network models (SIMPLE RNN, LSTM, BILSTM, GRU, BIGGRU, 1D CONVENTIONAL) were used to train on the training set of the IMDB dataset. And then these same pre-trained models were run on the test set, to find the best model based on certain parameters.
